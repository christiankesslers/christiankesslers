Gas fees when sending, swapping, and other functions involving the movement of your tokens, Ether will be required to fund your action.



To send a transaction, you'll first need ETH for gas. We recommend having around 0.01 ETH for 2 - 3 transactions.



When you're ready, select the up 'sending' arrow on your colorful account card. Then paste the address you want to send to, select the crypto you'd like to send, and confirm the transaction. You should be updated as soon as it starts sending and when it finishes.
