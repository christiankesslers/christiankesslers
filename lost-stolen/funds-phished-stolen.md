Thanks for reaching out.



We are a client-side interface that allows users to interact with the blockchain in various ways, including generating wallets and managing smart contracts. Only users themselves can access and control their funds - this is the purpose of decentralized networks.



It is nearly impossible to get your funds stolen with the MEW Wallet App. One needs to physically have your phone on them, followed by a biometric or pin confirmation.



Did you import your wallet address? Have you entered your phrases on another site?



Have you checked on Etherscan or ETHvm to find out what transactions are in your public wallet address?



Please let me know so that I can further assist you.
