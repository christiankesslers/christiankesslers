Thank you for contacting us!

When having ETC sent to your MEW account, itâ€™s important to remember that ETC is now a different blockchain from Ethereum. You can see and interact with your ETC funds on MEW web by switching your network.

In order to do so, you first need to access your wallet by selecting 'Change' in the top-right corner of the MEW web interface. From here, select the ETC network. You should see your ETC funds available for interaction.

Keep in mind that some methods of access, such as MEW CX, Metamask, or any other third-party connection method, you may not be able to change your network. This is due to the fact that the network is determined before access, and it cannot be changed in these scenarios.

I hope that helps! Please let me know if you have any more questions.
