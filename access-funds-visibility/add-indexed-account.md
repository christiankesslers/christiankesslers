# ðŸª— Add Indexed Account

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="English" %}
Please first try to add accounts. It should be an option near your multi-colored account card.





Sometimes your address is made within an index, or in a slot, of a larger contract to allow for unlimited account creation.





By creating arbitrary accounts within that wallet, it will hopefully reveal the indexed wallet with your funds.



I hope this will solve your issue!
